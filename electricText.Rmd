You need to create an API Client to start using the Genius API. It says " create an API client for your application. This will provide you with a client_id and a client_secret that you'll use to identify your application to Genius."

Interactively explore API endpoints by connecting your Genius account to this page.

From the dosumentation 


"Using An Access Token

To make authenticated requests with an access token, include it in an HTTP Authorization header preceded by the word "Bearer" and a space. For example, the value of the header could be Bearer 1234tokentokentoken.

Passing the token in the authorization header is the preferred way to authenticate API requests. However, the API also supports providing the token as the access_token query parameter of a GET request or element of a POST body.

GET /some-endpoint HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: CompuServe Classic/1.22
Accept: application/json
Host: api.genius.com
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN

"

"Response Format

All Genius API responses are JSON. Every JSON response has a meta field with a status value that is an integer representation of the HTTP status code for the response.

For successful requests, there is also a top-level response field which will be a nested object. For example, a request for details about annotations on a web page:"

"Songs
A song is a document hosted on Genius. It's usually music lyrics.

Data for a song includes details about the document itself and information about all the referents that are attached to it, including the text to which they refer.

GET /songs/:id"

"Artists
An artist is how Genius represents the creator of one or more songs (or other documents hosted on Genius). It's usually a musician or group of musicians.

GET /artists/:id"


R library to access genius data: https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr

it says: 
"Create a Genius API client
Generate a client access token from your API Clients page
Set your credentials in the System Environment variable GENIUS_API_TOKEN by calling the genius_token() function and entering your Genius Client Access Token when prompted."

Once you have the genius token, run `genius_token()` and if it is not set, you will be prompted to enter the token that you just created. This will set the System Environment variable GENIUS_API_TOKEN and should normally only be needed to run once.
